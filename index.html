        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for his breakthrough contributions to
             contemporary physics. His theory of relativity, namely the equation E = mc², transformed our understanding of space, time,
              and energy. In 1921, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which established the groundwork for quantum theory.
               Einstein's theories transformed science and technology, ranging from nuclear energy to space travel. He also promoted civil rights and global peace.
                After fleeing Nazi Germany, he lived in the United States and worked at Princeton until his death.</p>

            <h2>Einstein’s Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <h5>Einstein’s theory of relativity transformed physics,
                 making space and time relative and showing the link between mass and energy (E=mc²).
                  General relativity explained gravity as the warping of spacetime by massive objects, 
                  revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos and leading to breakthroughs in fields like astronomy and technology, including GPS systems.</h5>

            <h2> Einstein and Quantum Mechanics</h2>
            <h5>Einstein is most recognized for his work on relativity, but he also made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, particularly on the photoelectric effect. His discovery that light acts as both particles and waves earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize.
                 While Einstein expressed qualms about the probabilistic nature of quantum theory, 
                 his contributions helped to establish the field, which was later advanced by scientists like as Bohr
                  and Heisenberg.</h5>

            <h2>Bose-Einstein Condensate: A New State of Matter</h2>
            <h5>Einstein and physicist Satyendra Nath Bose postulated that at extremely low temperatures,
                 particles may create a new state of matter known as the Bose-Einstein Condensate. 
                 This was confirmed in 1995, and it changed quantum physics by demonstrating 
                how atoms can function as a single entity under specific conditions. 
                Their work established the basis for modern atomic research.</h5>

        <h1>Achievements</h1>
        <h5>Between 1905 and 1925, Albert Einstein revolutionized physics by developing the theory of relativity,
             which rendered space and time relative while established the speed of light as constant.
              His famous equation, E=mc², demonstrated the equivalence between mass and energy. 
              He also made contributions to quantum theory, suggesting light as both particles and waves, 
              for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1921. Einstein's work in general relativity changed cosmology,
               and his collaboration with Satyendra Nath Bose in 1924 resulted in the invention of Bose-Einstein statistics.</h5>

        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h5>
            Albert Einstein had several hobbies that reflected his curious and creative nature. He was an avid violinist, finding solace and joy in playing music, especially the works of Mozart and Bach. Music was a lifelong passion, helping him relax and think more clearly. Einstein also enjoyed sailing, often spending time on the water despite being a poor swimmer. 
            Reading was another cherished activity, with philosophy and 
            science fiction among his favorite genres. Additionally, Einstein loved puzzles and mental challenges, 
            keeping his mind sharp outside of work.</h5>
